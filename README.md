# PowerStones
Minecraft mod with overlapping wires of Redstone, Bluestone, Greenstone and Yellowstone

## Dependencies

Mods needed to be installed in order for PowerStones to function correctly:

| Mod           | Version | Reason |
| ------------- | ------- | ------ |
| [FerriteCore] | >=5.1.0 | This dependency enables Minecraft to load with the default 4GB of RAM, instead of 12GB which requires the addition of an argument (-Xmx12G). |
